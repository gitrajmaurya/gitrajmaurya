I'm happy to introduce myself. Here are some things about me:

- 🐦 I used to be very active on Twitter, but now I'm taking a break (downgraded to X). You can see my old tweets [@rajmauryafr].
- 💻 I love playing with tech. I use MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to make cool web stuff, React Native to make awesome mobile apps, and both front-end and back-end skills to make the web world work.
- 🌐 I like working on projects that make the internet more lively and interactive. Let's work together to make something amazing!
- 🎓 When I'm not coding, I'm studying Manga. Yes, I'm learning about the secrets of the universe along with my tech adventures.

## 🚀 My Tech Playground
- **Frontend:** I make beautiful and smooth websites with React, Nextjs & Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** I build the logic and functionality behind the scenes with Node.js and Express.js.
- **Data Storage:** I handle data like a boss, using MongoDB or MySQL.
- **Other Interests:** I'm fascinated by real-time web magic, anime, and the mysteries of the cosmos.

## 🤝 Let's Team Up!
I like working with others and trying new things. If you have a project idea or need some help with any of the tech stuff I do, feel free to contact me! You can find me on Twitter or send me a message here on GitHub.
